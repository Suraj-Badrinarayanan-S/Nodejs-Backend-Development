### Tools and Technology:
➡️ Node JS + Express for backend development

➡️ MongoDB Atlas for database

➡️ JWT Token and bcrypt modules for Authentication and Authorisation

## Project Workflow:
Developed and Designed a Library Management System (Backend) where there are 2 types of users:

➡️ Normal Users/ Customers

➡️ Super User/ Admin

Both Customers and Admin is verified using JWT token and passwords of the Customers are hashed using bcrypt for complete security.

Admin users can CREATE, READ, UPDATE AND DELETE the information of the books whereas Customers can only perform READ operation the book.

Customers can visit the home/ about pages whereas Admins can visit home/ about pages and admin pages.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of CRUD operations and Image upload functionality (by Admins) in the backend and securing the User/ Admin login session and hashing the passwords using Node js modules.
